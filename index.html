<p> A lightweight and user-friendly programming language, made by a programmer for a programmer. This programming language was made using the QBASIC interpreter, or rather interface. This programming language is indirectly linked with C++. Thus, it is just as fast as C++. There are two versions of PL, the slow-executing but feature-packed version and the fast-executing but slow version. The second one is primarily for learning and the first one is for making actual programs. Here is a example program made with this programming language:</p>
<pre>
clear()
input("Enter your age: ", user_age)
if(user_age > 18) {
println "You are eligible to vote!"
else {
println "You are not eligible to vote!"
}
}
</pre>
<p> Seems easy right? Then, why not jump right into programming? </p>
