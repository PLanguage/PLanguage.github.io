<p> There are two types of PL, the Fast-Executing but Lacking Features and the Slow-Executing but Feature Packed version. Download the first one if you want to learn the basics, but download the second one if you actually want to make something out of it :) </p>
<p> ALSO! Let's call them the PL.QB64 and PL.QB that would be better! PL.QB will require DOSBOX and any version of QBASIC to run. Just download the code, open it, run it, enter your program's location(source code) and BOOM! You'll be greeted with your program! We are currently working hard on the QB64 version, there are still many things to add there, and after that, it would become a completely different language! Until that time, learn PL as far as you can!</p>
